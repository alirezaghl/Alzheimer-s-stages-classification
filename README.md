# Transfer learning for early detection of Dementia!
The project is about classifying four stages of Dementia. All classes are labeld.
A number of problems were encountered during the course of the project. The first was the small size of the data set, which consisted of only around 6000 images for the training set. Secondly, the dataset was unbalanced for a single class.
Due to the difference between transfer learning models trained on natural images and medical images, we unfrozen all layers and updated the weights for all layers\
[this was our team project(Taco) in NMA 2022 DL! hope you enjoy!]
