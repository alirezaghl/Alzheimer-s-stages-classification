# Transfer learning for early detection of Dementia!
The project is about classifying four stages of Dementia.\
All classes are labeld.
During the project, we encountered two problems.

The first problem was that dataset was small, with only approximately 6000 images for the training set.
The second problem was that the dataset was unbalanced for a single class.\
[this was our team project(Taco) in NMA 2022 DL! hope you enjoy!]
